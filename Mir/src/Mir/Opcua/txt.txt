i wanna store data from opcua. more specifically i wanna store nodes. nodes have various attributes. most importatnt being namespace, ID, Datatype, value, child. How to make good way to store and acces this kind of data?. Im thinking about struct but that seems difficult to store childs of nodes. on thought was map but key should be namespace and ID together. Do u have ideas? maybe map of structs with somehow pointing to childss im a bit lost
